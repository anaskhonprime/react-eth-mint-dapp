    "NFTPRIME is a collection of algorithmically generated droid characters designed by NFT Master and minted as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. The 1st generation of 5,555 droids will be constructed from various metal outfits, tin faces, digital accessories, top pieces, faces, backpacks, arms, and colors. NFTPRIME have different body types, some rarer than others, and... there are rumors that you could find humans pretending to be robots too. Is it true?",
  content2:
    "The images & Prime metadata will be released after Prime NFTs sell out. We will update collectors via our Discord with the date/time of when the content will be available. Once the metadata is updated, your Roboto GIF will appear on OpenSea, and you will be able to download the additional file formats from our website.",

    "By collecting NftPrime you'll have a voice in the community and help guide the direction of the project and development of the story. Already some great ideas have come from the community. Working together we can continue the grow the Prime ecosystem!",
